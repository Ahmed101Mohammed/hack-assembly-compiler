# Assembly Compiler
It's a compiler for the Hack machine I built with [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome).

## Project description
### App functionality:
The app is a compiler, that compiles assembly code to binary code, that Hack machine can understand.
### App technologies:
I used just Java as a programming language.

## Installing & Running:
### Install the project:
To install the project you can open your terminal and enter this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed101Mohammed/hack-assembly-compiler.git
```
### Run the project:
You can follow the following steps to compile your assembly code:
> 1. Enter the project folder, after installing it.
> 2. Put the file that you want to compile in the root of the project.
> 3. Run the project, by compiling the Main.java file, which should lead to compiling all dependent files that Main.java uses.

## How to use the compiler:
> 1. Just so you know â€“ the program will ask you to input the name of your file without the extension, follow the instructions.
> 2. Finally, you will get the results with a separate file ending with the **hack** extension.

## License:
There is no famous specific license, but I give you all the ability to use this project for good reasons, and I will be thanked for sharing my GitHub account as a creator for this basic compiler.
Thanks.
