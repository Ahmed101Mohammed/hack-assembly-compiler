# Assembly Compiler
It's a compiler for the Hack machine I built with [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome).
## Project description
### App functionality:
The app is a compiler, that compiles assembly code to binary code, that Hack machine can understand.
### App technologies:
I used just Java as a programming language.
